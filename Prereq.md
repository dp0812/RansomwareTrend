# Prerequisites: Tools You Need

Before you start, make sure you have these essential tools installed on your system. If a minimum version is listed, please check yours! Otherwise, any version works.

---

### 1. **GIT** (The Cloning Tool)

* **What it does:** Essential for getting this code from the internet (GitHub) onto your computer. If you use linux, this typically is already in there. 
* **Check your version:**
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
* **Minimum Version:** None specified.

### 2. **JDK** (Java Development Kit)

* **What it does:** Required to compile and run the Java source files included in the project.
* **Check your version:**
    ```bash
    java --version
    ```
* **Minimum Version:** **25.0.1** or newer.

### 3. **Node.js** and **npm** (The Web Engine)

* **What they do:** Needed to set up and run the visual components (frontend, build scripts, web server).
* **Check your versions:**
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
* **Minimum Version:** None specified.

### 4. **Python 3** (Optional Backup Tool)

* **What it does:** This is a **backup**. It can quickly start a local web server if your browser has trouble opening the visualization file directly from your computer due to a security feature - I have this problem on my ubuntu distro.
* **Check your version:**
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
* **Minimum Version:** Python 3.13.2 or newer.
